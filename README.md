# TSPHG Test

My implementation of the tsphg test. It is functional but I need to make some improvements I ran out of time as I had other tests to do. It was a challenging task that I enjoyed and can maybe look to the future for finishing it.

## TODO

* Add design and make it responsive.
* Use Redux where setState is called. This would take time to set up all the action creators and reducers.
* Probably no use material-ui components as they interact with weird behaviours.
* Need to figure out a way to set the required and disabled fields through the schema. I do not want to manually traverse the tree. Maybe make use of the underscore library.

After creation, your project should look like this:


## How to build

Make sure you have yarn installed globally:

    npm install -g yarn

Run the following commands on the CLI from the project directory.

To build the modules just run from the root directory:

    yarn install

To start that application just use:

    yarn statr
    
This should automatically open the application in your default browser. However you can always access from:

    http://localhost:3030

[Application](http:/localhost:3000)
